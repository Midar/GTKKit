GTKKit is a multithreaded MVC GUI framework, which implements a UIKit-style
Objective-C API on top of the GTK+ cross-platform widget toolkit. It is under
active development, and it currently in a barely usable, skeletal state.

GTKKit is inspired by UIKit, but is not a clone of it, nor is it intended to be
compatible with it. It is intended to give experienced Cocoa/iOS developers a
comfortable, familiar environment to develop cross-platform applications, and
to introduce concepts from the Cocoa/iOS world to developers for other platforms.

Requirements:
 - GTK+ 3
 - ObjFW (https://webkeks.org/objfw/)
 - Doxygen (optional, for generating API documentation)

At the moment, GTKKit is only tested on OS X and FreeBSD.

Currently, GTKKit implements the following class hierarchy:

GTKResponder
  GTKApplication
  GTKView
    GTKActionBar
    GTKBox
    GTKControl
      GTKButton
      GTKInfoBar
      GTKPopUpButton
        GTKComboBox
      GTKSegmentedControl
      GTKSlider
      GTKTextField
    GTKImageView
    GTKLevelIndicator
    GTKProgressIndicator
    GTKSeparator
    GTKStatusbar
  GTKViewController
    GTKLinearViewController
    GTKListViewController
    GTKOffscreenRenderingViewController
    GTKPopOverViewController
    GTKSplitViewController
    GTKTabbedViewController
    GTKWindowViewController
      GTKTabbedWindowViewController
GTKImage
GTKEvent
GTKDispatchQueue
GTKLayoutConstraints
