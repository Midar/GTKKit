GTKKit is a wrapper library, written in and for Objective-C, which makes the GTK+ user interface toolkit (among other related libraries) available to the Objective-C programmer in a useful, simplified manner. It reduces the amount of code a programmer needs to write compared to plain C, while maintaining full compatibility with all existing C code.
