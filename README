GTKKit is a wrapper library, written in and for Objective-C,
which makes the GTK+ user interface toolkit available to the
Objective-C programmer in a useful, simplified manner. It
reduces the amount of code a programmer needs to write
compared to plain C, while maintaining full compatibility
with all existing C code. It is currently in a barely
usable, extremely skeletal state.

Requirements: 
 - GTK+ 3
 - ObjFW (https://webkeks.org/objfw/)
 - Doxygen
 - Tup (http://gittup.org/tup/)

If all the requirements are installed, just run build.sh as
a normal user and install.sh as root to install.

At the moment, GTKKit is only tested on OS X.

By default, GTKKit installs in /opt/local. To change that,
set the CONFIG_PREFIX variable in the tup.config file in
the project root directory.
