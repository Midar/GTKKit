GTKKit is a wrapper library, written in and for Objective-C,
which makes the GTK+ user interface toolkit available to the
Objective-C programmer in a useful, simplified manner. It
reduces the amount of code a programmer needs to write
compared to plain C, while maintaining full compatibility
with all existing C code. It is currently in a barely
usable, extremely skeletal state.

Requirements: 
 - GTK+ 3
