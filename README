GTKKit is a wrapper library, written in and for Objective-C, which makes the
GTK+ user interface toolkit available to the Objective-C programmer in a useful,
simplified manner. It reduces the amount of code a programmer needs to write
compared to plain C, while maintaining full compatibility with all existing C
code. It is currently only partially usable, but is under continuous
development.

Requirements:
 - GTK+ 3
 - ObjFW (https://webkeks.org/objfw/)

At the moment, GTKKit is only tested on OS X and FreeBSD.

Currently, GTKKit implements the following widget classes, to a greater or
lesser extent:

  GTKActionBar
  GTKButton
  GTKCheckButton
  GTKComboBox
  GTKEntry
  GTKExpander
  GTKFrame
  GTKGrid
  GTKHeaderBar
  GTKImage
  GTKLabel
  GTKListBox
  GTKMenu
  GTKMenuItem
  GTKOverlay
  GTKPopover
  GTKProgressBar
  GTKRadioButton
  GTKRevealer
  GTKScale
  GTKScrolledWindow
  GTKSeparator
  GTKSwitch
  GTKTextView
  GTKToggleButton
  GTKWindow
